Vigilance charges stack if a character gains more than one. A character can spend any number of charges of Vigilance for one of the following effects, rolling 1d6 per charge spent and picking the highest result: • When an ally in range 2 is damaged by a foe’s ability, reduce the damage by the amount rolled as if with armor • When a foe breaks adjacency with you, deal that much damage to them.",
      "Vigor": "Gain a shield that goes over your hit points, equal to your VIT value. Damage goes to Vigor before Hit Points, and it benefits from armor and resistance. Vigor stacks, but cannot go past 25% of your hp. If you gain a vigor surge, gain maximum vigor. Lose all vigor at the end of combat."
