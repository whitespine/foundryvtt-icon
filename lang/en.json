Vigilance charges stack if a character gains more than one. A character can spend any number of charges of Vigilance for one of the following effects, rolling 1d6 per charge spent and picking the highest result: • When an ally in range 2 is damaged by a foe’s ability, reduce the damage by the amount rolled as if with armor • When a foe breaks adjacency with you, deal that much damage to them.",

Vigor stacks, but cannot go past 25% of your hp. If you gain a vigor surge, gain maximum vigor. Lose all vigor at the end of combat."
